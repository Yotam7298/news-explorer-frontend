### News-Explorer Frontend

This is the frontend side of the News-Explorer final project

## React

The frontend of the app was created with React, structuring components to render all parts of the app, using state variables and hooks to make the app functional.
React router was used to route all components to render when needed and to protect components that should not be accessed

## Node.js

Node.js is implemented to manage external libraries and for making scripts for quick executing of frequently used commands, such as building a production build for deployment (npm run build) and for starting the app in the local machine (npm run start).
